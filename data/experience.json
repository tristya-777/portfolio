        "description": "During my internship at Microthings, I was involved in the development of a panel-based water leakage monitoring system using sensors and indicator lights. I contributed to hardware assembly, sensor calibration, and system testing to ensure reliable detection and response. This experience enhanced my technical skills in electronics and deepened my understanding of real-world engineering applications outside of IoT-based solutions."
